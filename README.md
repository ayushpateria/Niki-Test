# Niki-Test

Note: In the 2 hour test my plan was to first get the basic chat UI done and then use pub sub from PubNub to make it atleast a real chat app, though implementing the UI especially the two different layouts for sender and receiver message took me some one and half hour and I couldn't work on the PubNub part nicely.
In the app the chat functionality works properly locally (using dummy values), which you can test.
